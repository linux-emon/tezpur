            <p class="sectionTag text-big">1. Agnigarh</p>
        </a>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Agnigarh is a hillock located in Tezpur, Assam, India. In Hindu mythology, it is the site of the fortress which was built by Banasura to keep his daughter Usha in isolation. The name itself is derived from the words 'Agni' and 'garh' in Sanskrit.
Legend has it that this fortress was surrounded by fire at all times so that nobody could go in or out of the perimeter without permission. Usha fell in love with Aniruddha in her dreams, not knowing that he was the grandson of Krishna. Her companion Chitralekha identified him by painting his portrait from Usha's description. Chitralekha Udyan in Tezpur also known as 'Cole Park,' the biggest park in Tezpur, is named after her. Chitralekha was not only an artist but one possessing mystical powers. Anirudddha was Krishna's grandson and Usha, the daughter of an Asura king, therefore was no way any side would consent to their love. She flew one night and brought Aniruddha to Usha's place while he was still sleeping, using her powers. When Aniruddha opened his eyes and saw Usha, he fell in love immediately. However, Banasura was furious on knowing this, and tied him with snakes and imprisoned him. Lord Krishna, however had agreed for their marriage and had wanted for Banasura to consent for the same. Banasura was a great devotee of Lord Shiva, and as a boon had asked him and his entire family to guard the gates of his city, Tezpur. He therefore was not at all scared by Lord Krishna's wrath. A war ensued between the Hari (Lord Krishna and his followers) and the Hars (Lord Shiva and his followers), rivers of blood flowed and the city was named Tezpur (City of Blood). Both sides were nearly wiped out and a final battle followed between Lord Shiva and Lord Krishna, Lord Brahma requested both of them to stop the war by putting him between them. A discussion followed in which Lord Krishna made Lord Shiva see that Banasura was acting wrongly in imprisoning his grandson, and had even disrespected Lord Shiva himself in asking him and his family to be his gate keepers. Lord Shiva agreed, and Banasura was brought. Fearing his life he immediately agreed to the marriage.
Present day Agnigarh is a hill on the banks of the Brahmaputra which is one of the big tourist attractions in Tezpur. There is a circular stairway leading up to the crest of the hill where there are now sculptures depicting Usha's abduction of Aniruddha, the grandson of Krishna and the ensuing battle by Krishna to free them. There is a tall viewing platform from where the entire Tezpur town can be seen. We can also see the Kalia- Bhumura bridge which shines like a beautiful necklace over the vast Brahmaputra river.

        </a>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In the north eastern state of Assam, there are a number of relics of the olden times which remind one of the glorious past of the area. In the Bamuni hills of the district of Sonitpur, one may find such spectacular ruins, which attract a number of people to the region. On the right bank of the mighty Brahmaputra, the low hill names Bamuni is situated, which displays a number of awe inspiring stone carvings and statues of the bygone era. According to Hindu mythology, Aniruddha, the nephew of Lord Krishna, had fallen in love with the daughter of Banasura, who disapproving of the match had imprisoned Aniruddha in this place. The Archaeological Study of India, under whose control this area currently is, has fixed the date of these ruins at 10th to 12th century A.D. The style of the art excavated in this area indicates towards the Gupta period. It is however not clear as to who had this temple constructed, but it is generally believed that the temple was built during early Pala period. It is also assumed that this was a temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu, and it was a north Indian Nagara style temple.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Cole Park, Tezpur is a very picturesque park near the centre of Tezpur. It has recently been renamed as Chitralekha Udyan although both names are synonymous. The name is after a famous character in Agnigarh Aniruddha-Usha love story It has had a long tradition of hosting painting/drawing competitions for the nearby schools due to the various features it possesses. A replica of the famous Bhomoraguri inscription which recorded the ancient plans to build a bridge across the Brahmaputra where the current Kolia Bhomora Setu exists has been created in this park for public viewing. The park has facilities for paddle boating on the pond. It recently has added ' Bumping Cars ' to its list of amusements . Primary viewing attractions for children is a jet-fighter model Valiant MIG 21 the first supersonic aircraft for the Indian Air Force capable of travelling at Mach 2 ( with engines removed and fixed ) and a large concrete-made map of India ( states as before year 2000).

            There is a water feature in the form of a lake where small rowing and paddle boats are allowed.

        </a>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Located on the banks of river Brahamaputra, Ganesh Ghat has an alluring view and calmness of the huge river. The temple of Lord Ganesha on the ghat is quite old and has relics of stone carved idols of many Gods and Goddesses. The place is not yet developed as a tourist destination but more advancements in this direction are been taken now. The locals keep this place crowded and lively at all times of the year. There is also a small park nearby where stone slabs are installed for the visitors to sit and relax, facing the Mighty Brahmaputra which is around 10 km wide here. Stairs are built upto some depth inside the river so that the pilgrims can enjoy the river water when water level is low. The sunrise and sunset along the side of river is not to be missed. This is the reason that the place has become popular for short outings and picnics.

            The best time to visit the place is during winters. Ganesh Ghat Temple can be visited during timings 6:00 AM - 8:00 PM. People usually visit Ganesh Ghat in the evening to get a full view of the beautiful city.

        </a>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The Goddess Bhairavi is worshipped here as she is one of the Mahavidyas of Maa Durga Devi. It is a very important Shakti Peeth of Assam. The backdrop of the temple is a view looking towards the Kolia Bhomora Setu across the Brahmaputra River. The temple site is also locally known Bhairabi Devalaya. Legend has it that Usha (daughter of mighty Asura King Banasura) regularly came here for the worshipping of the Goddess.[1][2] About a couple of kilometres away lie the Bamuni Hills where one can view the ruins of the palace that stood many centuries ago. The art work on stone carvings that were used within the structure are from the 9th century. Likewise, the 400-year-old Bhairabi temple has tilted slightly and a nearby building suffered damage to the west and south sides of the second and third stories and cracked the pillars and an unhinged roof due to an earthquake. Following the damage, religious ceremonies or daily prayers have come to a halt.

        </a>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The ancient Mahabhairav Temple is located at a hillock on the northern part of Tezpur town in Assam, India.[1] This Shiva temple was originally built of stone but the present one was renovated and built with concrete. During the Ahom rule, the kings especially of the Tungkhungia dynasty donated large area of Devotee land to the Temple and appointed pujaris, Paiks to look after the temple. The temple is now managed by the Government of Assam through a managing committee headed by the Deputy Commissioner, Sonitpur. Maha Shivaratri the annual festival of Shaivite branch of Hinduism is celebrated in the temple complex with devotees coming from far and wide. Laddu laced with Bhang, an edible preparation of cannabis and also mixed with milk and spices, are offered as prasad to Lord Shiva as per the rituals.

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">8. Padum Pukhuri</p>
        </a>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">One of the most famous landmarks of Tezpur in Assam, Padum Pukhuri Lake, which literally means a lotus-pond, is a scenic lake with an island in it. The presence of the lake allows the toruists to engage in water sports such as rowing and paddling. The Padam Pukhuri Lake is located within Tezpur city limits.

            Padum Pukhuri has an island in the middle which is now converted into a park with a musical fountain. This island-park is connected with the mainland through an iron foot-bridge, which also is an added attraction affectionately enjoyed by the visitors. Several tourist water recreation activities including paddleboats, rowboats and others are offered on hire for the visitors at Padum Pukhuri Lake from time to time. A toy-train within the park is another attraction which is a joy for the kids as well as the adults. One of the biggest lakes in the lower Assam belt, Padum Pukhuri Lake is blessed with rich natural resources and situated close to Tezpur Town.
            
            Tezpur is one of the few tourist destinations in India to experience ideal weather to visit throughout the year. However the best time to visit the place is during the summers when the temperatures are moderate between 24-35 degrees which enable the tourists to have a pleasant experience.

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">9. Da Parbatia Temple</p>
        </a>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The antiquities found at the Dah Parvatiya are inferred to have been from a temple complex built during the 5th or 6th century, prior to the Bhaskaravarman period. On the basis of the moldings of the torso and its architectural style it is inferred that the terracotta plaques are definitely not later than the 6th century; the altered form of motifs noted in Assam confirms this assessment.

            This type of architectural feature, particularly in the molds of figurines of the ruins, is seen in North India, in the temples of the Bhumra and Nachha Kuthara which belonged to the Gupta period. Further confirmation of the dating is provided by the carvings of the river Goddesses Ganga and Yamuna, which are also akin to the Greek architecture with striking similarity to the Hellenistic art. The decorative elements of the ruins also have close similarity with those seen in the temples of Orissa.
            
            During the Ahom period, a Shiva temple was built with bricks over the ruins of an ancient Gupta period temple. When the Ahom period temple was destroyed during the Assam Earthquake of 1897, the remains of Gupta period temple were exposed but only in the form of a door frame made of stone. Epigraphic evidence and ancient literature found here, supplemented by the ruins seen scattered around the area, also confirms that in the pre-Ahom period Gupta art extended into the early Medieval period.
